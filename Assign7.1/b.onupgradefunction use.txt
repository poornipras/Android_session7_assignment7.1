b. What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?


1.onUpgrade is basically used for handling new database changes like adding new columns or table for any new version of the app.
Droping the table is not always necessary in onUpgrade. 
2.This method is called when the database needs to be upgraded. 
3.The implementation should use this method to drop tables, add tables, or do anything else it needs to upgrade to the new schema version.
4.The SQLite ALTER TABLE documentation can be found here. If you add new columns you can use ALTER TABLE to insert them into a live table. If you rename or remove columns you can use ALTER TABLE to rename the old table, then create the new table and then populate the new table with the contents of the old table.
5.This method executes within a transaction. If an exception is thrown, all changes will automatically be rolled back.

The syntax of the onUpgrade()is as follows:

void onUpgrade (SQLiteDatabase db, 
                int oldVersion, 
                int newVersion)
Parameters
db	SQLiteDatabase: The database.
oldVersion	int: The old database version.
newVersion	int: The new database version.


The SQLiteOpenHelper class requires the implementation of the following methods

public class DBHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper
 {
   public DBHelper()
   {
      super(context,DATABASE_NAME,null,1);
   }
   public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {}
   public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {}
}
